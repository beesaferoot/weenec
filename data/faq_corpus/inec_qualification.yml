  - "Recall is a procedure by which voters can remove a member of National Assembly or State House of Assembly in the constituency where he/she registered."
- - What is a referendum in a recall?
  - "A referendum in a recall is a direct vote that determines the question of whether the constituents wish to recall (remove) an elected member of an Area Council, State or National Assembly."
- - Who can recall an elected member?
  - "A member can be recalled by more than one half of the registered voters in his/her constituency presenting a petition to the Chairman of INEC."
- - What can the electorate do if they are not satisfied with the performance of their representatives?
  - "The electorate not satisfied with the performance of their representatives can present a petition to the Chairman of INEC for the recall of the representatives. The petition for recall must be signed by more than one half (50% + 1) of the total number registered voters in that constituency."

  - "On receipt of a petition by the Chairman of the Commission for the recall of a member of National or State Assembly signed by more than one half of the total number of persons registered to vote in that member’s constituency alleging their loss of confidence in that member, the Commission shall within ninety (90) days of the receipt of the petition ensure that:
      • The petition for recall presented is signed and arranged according to polling units, wards, LGA and constituency;
      • The Commission shall cross check that the signatories appear on the voters register;
      • The Commission shall notify the member sought to be recalled, stating the fact of the receipt of the petition for his/her recall;
      • The Commission shall issue a public notice or announcement stating the date, time and location of verification;
      • The Commission shall verify the signatories to the petition at the designated location;
      • If more than one half (50% + 1) of the signatories are verified, the Commission goes ahead to conduct a referendum;
      The member is recalled when more than half of the voters vote “yes” to recalling the member.
      It is to be noted that while the petition should be presented by more than half of the Registered Voters, in a referendum, the yardstick is the majority i.e. more than half of the turnout of voters;
      • If the number verified is less than one half of the registered voters in that constituency, the Commission shall write to the petitioners stating that the petition did not meet the minimum requirements and is therefore dismissed."
